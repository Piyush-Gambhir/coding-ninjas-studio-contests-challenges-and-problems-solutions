Problem statement
There is a frog on the '1st' step of an 'N' stairs long staircase. The frog wants to reach the 'Nth' stair. 'HEIGHT[i]' is the height of the '(i+1)th' stair.If Frog jumps from 'ith' to 'jth' stair, the energy lost in the jump is given by absolute value of ( HEIGHT[i-1] - HEIGHT[j-1] ). If the Frog is on 'ith' staircase, he can jump either to '(i+1)th' stair or to '(i+2)th' stair. Your task is to find the minimum total energy used by the frog to reach from '1st' stair to 'Nth' stair.

For Example
If the given ‘HEIGHT’ array is [10,20,30,10], the answer 20 as the frog can jump from 1st stair to 2nd stair (|20-10| = 10 energy lost) and then a jump from 2nd stair to last stair (|10-20| = 10 energy lost). So, the total energy lost is 20.
